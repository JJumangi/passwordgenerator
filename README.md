# **Random Password Generator Assignment**

## **Assignment Intention**
For this assignment:
* I was attempting to create a function that will unltimately create a randomized password for a user.
* In this assignment, you will be able to select from a few prompts to generate a randomized password. The user can select between 8-128 characters as well as choose between uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 
* This should all be completed after the user clicks the "generate" button and follows the prompts.
